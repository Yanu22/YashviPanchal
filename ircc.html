                <h2>Background
                </h2>
                <p>In collaboration with Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), we were asked to examine service delivery at the IRCC Client Support Center (CSC). Our project team explored the journey and challenges faced by Permanent Resident (PR) clients throughout the application process while contacting the CSC.Longer application processing times result in more calls to the Client Support Centre (CSC) of IRCC, which is caused by a combination of increasing caseloads, complex files, a lack of resources, and call centre agent capacity. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-column">
                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>To orient ourselves within the problem space, we conducted a literature review examining secondary sources such as published journal articles, newspaper articles, blogs, websites and social media. We developed a questionnaire in which we asked clients about their experiences with the application process and their interactions with IRCC through various channels. We used the results of the survey to inform interview questions for PR clients with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of client experiences and pain points. We also interviewed Subject Matter Experts including Immigration Consultants, Call Center Agents, UX Researchers and collaborated closely with IRCC to gain insight into their processes and eventually gain feedback on our proposed solutions. </p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>Clients felt that the application process was straightforward and self explanatory.
                    Clients felt the website was robust and had all or most of the information they needed to apply.
                    Clients turn to their friends and social media for guidance but know it’s not always reliable - they trust official sources more than social media.
                    Clients feel that the advertised timeline does not match actual application processing time they were experiencing.
                    Clients compare personal timelines between each other.
                    Clients are calling because they want to know what’s taking so long and what stage their file is.
                    
                    What clients really need is to know was if their application is okay - all they really want is to feel reassured.</p>

                <h2>Findings</h2>
                <p>The journey of every client got us to one thing, where all they really wanted to know was - what was happening to their file or if their file was still in progress or not. Apart from that, the key findings from our research also showed that the applicants want tailored responses to their questions, and most importantly, they want to know if their application is okay - all they really want to feel is - reassured. </p>
