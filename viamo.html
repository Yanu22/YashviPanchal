                </h2>
                <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>

                <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
                <p>Our secondary-research led us to a phenomenon where some of the victims eventually turn into activists themselves. And thatâ€™s when it struck us that these women are the key to unlocking the solution. As survivors of domestic violence, these women are Subject Matter Experts. Moreover, as motivated and self-initiated individuals, this group of people is very agile and resourceful. Unfortunately, these resources are not always distributed equally, so while one activist has access to one, she might lack access to another. Recognizing an opportunity here, Team 3, in collaboration with Viamo, explores how IVR technologies can be used to help build a community of activists against domestic violence in Mozambique to make it easier and faster to help victims by quicker circulation of resources. </p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>After spending time with the problem, appropriate iceberg models to isolate key pain-points, personas were extrapolated and a system-map were weaved together. Based on the information from these systems, the team fabricated various low and high fidelity IVR prototypes of proposed interventions to help the activists. After drafting the interventions, we presented them to Viamo. Invaluable feedback from the Viamo stakeholders were then taken into account and the solution intervention subsequently underwent various phases of iterations to create a proposal. </p>
