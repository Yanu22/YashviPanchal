                <h2>Background
                </h2>
                <p>The Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPP-D) pension is a taxable monthly benefit that offers partial earnings replacement for eligible CPP contributors between the ages of 18 and 65 who have a severe and persistent disability that frequently prevents them from working. To evaluate eligibility, and more specifically, whether the person is unable to pursue any substantially gainful activity consistently, a mix of medical condition(s), accompanying functional limitations, and personal characteristics (age, education, transferable skills) are taken into account. However, the CPP statutory definition of disability and related adjudication policy is broad and non-diagnosis based, and the courts have already reaffirmed this.</p>

                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                <p>Feedback from persons with disabilities and other stakeholders indicates that accessing the existing suite of disability programs is often cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to navigate. These challenges can contribute to frustration in accessing support, as well as feelings of disempowerment and disrespect. To address these concerns, the Disability Adjudication Policy Division (DAPD) is conducting a review of actual federal programs and benefits and is recommending changes based on knowledge of how eligibility processes are experienced.  </p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>This project used HCD methodology to provide contextualized evidence of the current pain points experienced by both individuals attempting to access the program or benefit as well as those responsible for administering it, and develop recommendations to improve the process eligibility for CPP-D. The project was carried out in 16 weeks and was divided into 3 phases: Discovery Phase, Analysis Phase and Findings Phase. <br>The objectives of this report cover the following key areas:
                    <br>
<ul>
                  <li>  Identified overlapping friction points between the experiences of users, stakeholders, and government</li>
                  <li> Identified key opportunities for policy and program innovation to improve the eligibility processes and user experiences for the CPP-D program;</li>
                    <li> Key recommendations to address the opportunity areas.</li></ul> </p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>After synthesizing the data from the semi-structured interviews with clients, internal and external subject matter experts and thoroughly comprehending how the CPP-D program operated, the research team from the Human-Centred Design Lab compiled a list of the following key insights:
<ul>
                    <li>1. Clients need help with the application process</li>
                    <li> 2. Incomplete Medical Reports</li>
                        <li>3. The functional capacity self assessment is being overlooked</li>
                            <li>4. Inconsistencies in the process</li>
                                <li> 5. Disconnected Communication </li>

            <h2>How Might We Statement</h2>
            <li><h3>Clients need help with the application process</h3>
                <p>- How Might We make clients feel assured that they are submitting an application form they are satisfied with? 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Clientsâ€™ perspective is being overlooked</h3>
                <p>- How Might We make clients feel more empowered throughout the process?</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3> Incomplete medical reports</h3>
                <p>- How Might We prompt physicians to provide more information about a patient's medical condition?</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Inconsistencies in the process</h3>
                <p>- How Might We make the evaluation process more consistent for medical adjudicators? </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Disconnected communication</h3>
                <p>- How Might We improve communication between departments to deliver updates in the overall process more efficiently?</p>
            </li>

            <h2>Opportunities</h2>
            <li><h3>Redesign the CPP-D toolkit and add it to the application form</h3>
                <p>- Adding the CPP-D benefit toolkit in the application form, as the toolkit covers all the important criteria to be considered by the clients. Additionally, redesign the toolkit to be more interactive, using web accessibility to help people with disabilities.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>More emphasis on the functional capacity self-assessment</h3>
                <p>- Advising medical adjudicators to give more emphasis on the functional capacity self-assessment to make clients feel more empowered through the process.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Clear and Specific Guidelines to Physicians</h3>
                <p>- Providing clear and specific guidelines to physicians that include what important information and documentation they should provide in the medical report.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Consistent training of Medical Adjudicators among different regions.</h3>
                <p>- Inconsistencies among different regions was one of the major points highlighted during the user interviews, providing consistent training might lead to fewer inconsistencies in the adjudication process.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Frequent meetup between and within departments</h3>
                <p>- Encouraging frequent meetups between and within departments to share their experiences and challenges while also discussing changes implemented would make the process less cumbersome for clients and stakeholders.</p>
            </li>
